<h2>ABOUT THE TOOLBOX</h2>

TO BE COMPLETED

    <p>
      The toolbox can be downloaded <a target="_parent"
      href="https://github.com/atcollab/at">here</a>.
Accelerator Toolbox (AT) is a collection of tools to model storage rings and beam transport lines in Matlab.

With AT it is possible to:

<ul>
<li> create and manipulate accelerator lattice elements, which are stored in Matlab structures </li>
<li> track particles through the lattice, selecting the appropriate integrator to represent the physics </li>
<li> compute accelerator parameters and beam properties, generating new scripts or taking advantage of the existing ones</li>
</ul>

Examples of things AT enables are: create a lattice structure that links to the integrators, and then to track through the lattice
including non-linear elements, analyze the non-linear motion, change settings to affect parameters, compute equilibrium beam sizes
with radiation, and so on.
    </p>

<h2>ABOUT THE DOCUMENTATION</h2>

    The bulk of this documentation was produced automatically from the
    Matlab m-files of the toolbox using <b><a
    href="http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/">m2html</a></b>.
